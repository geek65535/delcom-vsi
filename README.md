===============

ruby interface to Delcom Engineering "Visual Signal Indicator" (VSI)

interface to Delcom Engineering VSI, first generation (http://www.delcomproducts.com/products_USBLMP.asp). This should work with the second generation, but I don't have a unit to test with.

This is based on a Perl module that Wade Johnson and I built: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Device-Delcom-VSI/
